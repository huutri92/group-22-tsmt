			<p>Dear &lt;salutation&gt;</p>
			<p><b>Re: Cheque Dishonoured By the Bank</b></p>
			<p>You recently made a payment to your Morses account(s) by cheque.</p>
			<p>Cheque Number: &lt;cheque_number&gt;<br>
			Cheque Amount &lt;amount&gt;<br>
			Cheque Presented By: &lt;sjfsjfj&gt;</p>
			<p>Accounts &lt;account_id&gt;<br>
			Balance &lt;balance&gt;</p>
			<p>I regret to inform you that your bank has dishonoured the cheque. The value of the payment has, therefore, has been added back onto your account(s), together with an administration charge of Â£10.00 on account number &lt;account_id&gt;</p>
			<p>In order to bring your payments back up to date, would you please make the payments up by paying your agent in cash on their next visit.</p>
			<p>We will not be able to accept any further payments on your account(s) by cheque unless accompanied by a valid cheque guarantee card number covering the value of the cheque.</p>
			<p>Yours sincerely</p>
