			<p>Following a reorganisation of our sales-force, it is with regret that we have to inform you that we are no longer able to arrange for collection of your weekly payments on the above account. </p>
			<p>It will now be necessary for you to make payments direct to the Worcester Office. If you have more than one Morses account, we have merged all the balances to one new account to make it easier for you to make payments. </p>
			<p>Your new account number is quoted at the top of this letter, and you must quote this account number when making payments.</p>
			<p>The weekly payment for your account, under the terms of your agreement is «TERMS» per week, however we suggest that you make your payments monthly.</p>
			<p>In order to make this as easy as possible for you to make payments, we are able to offer 3 options for payment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>By sending a cheque to the address above. Please write your new account number and your name and address clearly on the back of the cheque.</li>
				<li>Or by completing the enclosed Giro slip and taking it to your local Post Office with your payment. No fee is charged for this service. On receipt of your first payment, we will send you further Giro slips.</li>
				<li>If you would prefer to pay by standing order through your bank, please telephone the number below, and we will send you the necessary standing order mandate.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whilst regular monthly payments are being made, we are pleased to inform you that no further interest will be added to the account. However, if no payments are received for a period exceeding two months, then we shall have no option but to pass your account to a Collection Agency. We would therefore urge you to ensure that a payment is made every month to prevent us from having to take this action.</p>
			<p>We look forward to receiving your payment, but if you have any queries relating to this changed method of payment, then please do not hesitate to contact me on 01905 742102.</p>
			<p>Yours sincerely</p>
			<p>Jan Daniel<br>
