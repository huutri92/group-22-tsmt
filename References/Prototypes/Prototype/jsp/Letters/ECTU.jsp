			<p>Dear &lt;salutation&gt;</p>
			<p align="center"><b>Would you like £<> of credit to go shopping in Argos</b></p><br>
			<p>As you already know Argos is a great store, offering real value for money and lots of choice. So, if you’ve found your Extra Card useful when shopping in Argos, don’t forget you can top-up your card. If interested, we can give you £&lt;&gt; to spend….right now.</p>

			<p align="center"><b>It Couldn’t be easier</b></p>
			<p>Your Representative top’s up your card and you continue to make regular payments. They include the value added to the card and a 5.0% administration charge that applies to the initial top-up and credits.</p>
			<p>Then, you can normally start shopping again within two working days.</p>
			<p align="center"><b>What to do next</b></p>
			<p>Just talk to your representative, who will tell you everything you need to know.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Yours sincerely</p><br>

			<p><b>Typical Example;</b></p>
			<p><b>20 Week Revolving Credit Account APR 60.1% Variable.</b></p>
			<p>The minimum weekly payment is calculated to ensure that the account is balanced after 20 weeks, allowing for interest charges. The interest rate is 4.0% of the proceeding month’s balance and the interest is applied each calendar month. You can pay more than the minimum weekly payment or the total outstanding balance at any time. Your representative can tell you what the balance of your is at any time and how much your minimum payment is.</p>
			<p><b>Typical Example:</b> The £100 value of your Morses Club Extra Card, plus a 5.0% administration charge, totals £105. The balance is payable over 20 weeks, which will result in a total amount payable of £116.61 <b>APR 60.1%</b></p>
