			<p>Dear &lt;salutation&gt;</p>
			<p align="center"><b>Would you like £100 of credit to go shopping in Argos</b></p><br>
			<p>Most people think Argos offers convenience and real value for money. If you agree, we can give you £100 to spend in this great store….right now.</p>
			<p>Morses Club’s Extra Card is a store card that enables you to shop in any Argos store, with the added benefit that you can pay for the card over 20 weeks and ‘top-up’ the card if you want to go shopping again.</p>

			<p align="center"><b>It Couldn’t be easier</b></p>
			<p>Your Representative set’s up an account into which you make your weekly repayments. They include the value added to the card and a 5.0% administration charge top’s up your card and you continue to make regular payments. They include the value added to the card and a 5.0% administration charge that applies to the initial top-up and credits.</p>
			<p>Then, we give you your Extra Card and you can normally start shopping within two working days.</p>
			<p align="center"><b>What to do next</b></p>
			<p>If you are interested, just talk to your representative, who will tell you everything you need to know.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Yours sincerely</p><br>

			<p><b>Typical Example;</b></p>
			<p><b>20 Week Revolving Credit Account APR 60.1% Variable.</b></p>
			<p>The minimum weekly payment is calculated to ensure that the account is balanced after 20 weeks, allowing for interest charges. The interest rate is 4.0% of the proceeding month’s balance and the interest is applied each calendar month. You can pay more than the minimum weekly payment or the total outstanding balance at any time. Your representative can tell you what the balance of your is at any time and how much your minimum payment is.</p>
			<p><b>Typical Example:</b> The £100 value of your Morses Club Extra Card, plus a 5.0% administration charge, totals £105. The balance is payable over 20 weeks, which will result in a total amount payable of £116.61 <b>APR 60.1%</b></p>
